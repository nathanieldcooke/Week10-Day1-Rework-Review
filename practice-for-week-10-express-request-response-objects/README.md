# Practice: Express Request/Response Objects

In this project, you will explore the request and response objects in Express.

## Getting started

Download the starter. `cd` into the __server__ folder, and run `npm install`.

Open __server/app.js__ and notice the framework for an Express server has been
created for you. In between the Express initialization and the listener are a
series of phases for you to complete.

Start the server using `npm run dev` (for automatic rebuild on save). Open your
browser to [http://localhost:5000].

> Remember to refresh the browser after the server restarts whenever you make
> changes and save the code.

## Phases

Progress as far as you can through the phases until your instructor(s) begin the
follow-up discussion. You can finish any additional phases later as you prepare
for the assessment.

Bonus phases are optional. If you can do them, then you know you are
understanding the Express server at a deeper level.

* Basic Phase 1 - Plain-text response
* Basic Phase 2 - Route param and JSON response
* Basic Phase 3 - Query params in URL
* Intermediate Phase 4 - Custom message and HTTP status code when route is not
  found
* Advanced Bonus Phase A - Respond with a JSON object using values from the
  request object
* Advanced Bonus Phase B - Research how to return static files in a public
  folder

bonus phases.
